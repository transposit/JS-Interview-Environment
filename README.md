# Transposit JS Interview Environment Project

Hi! We are so glad you are taking the time to interview with us here at Transposit. As part of the interview experience, we offer candidates an option between using [CoderPad](https://app.coderpad.io/) and their own local environment for our coding interviews. To make the interview process run smoothly, we have created this project that will test out and make sure your environment is set up correctly.

## Prerequisites 

If you choose to use your own environment we ask that you have the following ready:

- node.js at least v14 or greater
- terminal
- your faviorite IDE for editing Typescript/Javascript/CSS/HTML


## Testing steps

Fork and clone this repo locally.
In the directory where you cloned this repo run: `npm install`. This should take a few minutes to install all the necessary packages.
Next run `npm run test:unit`. Both tests should run and succseed. 
Next run `npm run test:app`. This should execute the tests in the src directory for the React app.
Finally run `npm run start`. This should start a local dev environment and you should see the page with the Transposit logo.

If all these steps completed successfully your local environment is working correctly. We will be sending you another repo at the start of your interview. If anything does not work, please let us know ahead of time and we can either help you get set up.

Cheers
Transposit Team!
